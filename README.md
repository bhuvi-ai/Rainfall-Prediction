# Rainfall Prediction Project
The "weatherAUS" dataset on Kaggle offers comprehensive weather observations from Australian stations, including temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, and pressure data. Valuable for weather prediction and climate analysis, it supports research and machine learning applications for understanding Australian weather patterns.

## Overview
This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning techniques. It includes model development, deployment, and data analysis components.

## Data Description
The dataset (`weatherAUS.csv`) contains comprehensive weather observations from various stations across Australia. It includes features such as temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, and pressure data etc.
