        <h2>About Rain Fall Prediction</h2>
        <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">Rainy Fall Prediction is a web app which has a Machine Learning model running at the back. The purpose of developing this app is to predict whether it will rain the next day or not. This model is based on the Rain Prediction in Australia dataset.
            The codes for this project can be checked in my <a href="https://github.com//bhuvi-ai" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">github repo</a>. More than 80% of Australia has an annual rainfall of less than 600 mm which is less among the
            all continents other than Antartica which recieves less rainfall. A place inland near Lake Eyre would only receive 81 mm of rain annually. The average annual rainfall in the Australian desert is low, ranging from 81 to 250 mm. Thunderstorms
            are relatively common in the region, with an annual average of 15 to 20 thunderstorms. The southern parts of Australia get the usual westerly winds and rain-bearing cold fronts that come when high‚Äìpressure systems move towards northern Australia
            during winter. Cold snaps may bring frosts inland, though temperatures near the coast are mild or near mild all year round. Summers in southern Australia are generally dry and hot with coastal sea breezes. During a lengthy dry spell, hot and
            dry winds from the interior can cause bushfires in some southern and eastern states, though most commonly Victoria and New South Wales. The tropical areas of northern Australia have a wet summer because of the monsoon. During "the wet", typically
            October to April, humid north-westerly winds bring showers and thunderstorms. Occasionally, tropical cyclones can bring heavy rainfall to tropical coastal regions, which is also likely to reach further inland.
